# Kick-Into-Traction

This is the heroku deployment of Kick-Into-traction (KIT). For modelling repository please check: https://github.com/nmosto/kick-into-traction

Kick-Into-traction (KIT) is a web app that makes recommendations to users of Kickstarter's crowdsourcing platform on how to improve the likelihood of a campaign's success by optimizing features related to the images of a campaign.

KIT has analyzed tens of thousands of Kickstarter campaigns to try and uncover what image features differentiate successful campaigs from the unsuccessful ones. 

Some Key Features:

* Dullness
* Brightness
* Edge Behavior
* Blurriness (variance of the Laplacian filter)
* Average RGB 
* Dominant Colors (with K-means Clustering)
* Compression Size
* Aspect Ratio


Coming Soon:

* Simple Object Identification (convolutional neural networks)
