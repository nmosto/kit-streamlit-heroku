# kit-streamlit-heroku

This is my streamlit-heroku deployment of my project called kick-into-traction.

Kick-into-traction (KIT) is a web app that makes recommendations to users of Kickstarter's crowdsourcing platform on how to improve the likelihood of a campaign's success by optimizing features related to the low level structural aspects of images.

KIT has analyzed tens of thousands of Kickstarter campaigns to try and uncover what image features differentiate successful campaigs from the unsuccessful ones. 

Some Key Features:

* Dullness
* Brightness
* Edge Behavior
* Blurriness (variance of the Laplacian filter)
* Average RGB 
* Dominant Colors (with K-means Clustering)
* Compression Size
* Aspect Ratio


Coming Soon:

* Simple Object Itenfification
